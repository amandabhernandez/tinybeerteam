It's tiny beer time™️!

A group project for EH 263: Analytical Methods and Exposure Assessment. The study, "The Unexplored Microenvironment of a Microbrewery: An Evaluation of Particulate Matter in Beginning Stages of the Beer Brewing Process in a Somerville, MA Microbrewery" was conducted in the Fall of 2022. 

Here you can find the code for the analysis reported in the final paper, as well as the source code for an interactive dashboard created for the brewing staff to explore the data as it was collected during the study.
